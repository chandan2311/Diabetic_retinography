Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet)
Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for detecting diabetic retinopathy using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a focus on the ResNet architecture. Diabetic retinopathy is a serious eye condition that can lead to vision loss if not detected and treated early. CNNs have shown great promise in automating the detection of diabetic retinopathy by analyzing retinal images.

In this project, we utilize the power of ResNet to create an accurate and efficient model for diabetic retinopathy detection. This README provides an overview of the project
